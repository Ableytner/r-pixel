# r/Pixel 

This is basically a remake of the r/place subreddit, where people where able to put down a pixel of a color on a canvas every 5 minutes and in the end it results in a giant painting. 

The goal for this project is to implement the base funcionality of r/place and make it available at least for the school so that the students can draw on the canvas and make art together. 

## Specifications 

 - [ ] Create the website with all functionalities and run on localhost
 - [ ] Save coordinates, color, time and the user that put down the pixel in a csv file
 - [ ] Reach website through websockets 
 - [ ] Create Docker compose file
 - [ ] Write tests for the saving functionalities
